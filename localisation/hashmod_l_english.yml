 ger_2_desc:0 ""Heil dir im Siegerkranz", Hail to Thee in the Victor's Crown, was the German Empire's national anthem since it's formation, and was primarily a northern German Hymn. The tune sung praises for the freedom, scientific prowess, and glory of the German Peoples."
 ger_3_desc:0 "The German General Staff, originally the Prussian General Staff, was responsible for the continuous study of warfare, and the drawing up and reviewing of plans for mobilization or offensive campaigns. The Generalstab was distinguished as the earliest and most efficient of European centralized military commands, and enjoyed significant political leeway. This granted the German armed forces a significcant advantage against other continental opponents."
 ger_4_desc:0 "The Prussian military tradition is inspirational to the German armed forces, and many units and academies keep the Prussian traditions alive in song, nomenclature, and brutal effectiveness on the battlefield."
 ger_5_desc:0 "German bureaucracy enacts laws concerning the daily life of citizens of the empire to secure the local peace and public morality. The Polizeiordnung is derived from Plato's work Politeia, and strives to maintain order through just and good administration of public life, rather than police regulations."
 ger_6_desc:0 "The House of Thurn und Taxis pioneered the German postal service, a complex network of the communication which covers various European regions and all of Germany."
 ger_7_desc:0 "One of the effects of the unification policies was the gradually increasing tendency to eliminate the use of non-German languages in public life, schools and academic settings with the intent of pressuring the non-German population to abandon their national identity in what was called "Germanisation". These policies were targeted against Polish-speaking and south-German populations, increased percentages of german speaking populations in core regions, and allowed for a centrally unified education and beauracratic system."

 bra_1_desc:0 "In order to regularize control of the Mark of Brandenburg the early Hohenzollerns would replace local common law with Roman law. They would further regulate justice by moving the Supreme Court from the court of the Elector (who was prone to moving around) to fixed and central location. This simultaneously improved justice and curbed the power of local magnates."
 bra_2:0 "Divide the Estates"

 bra_4:0 "Noble Cadets"
 bra_4_desc:0 "Although the nobility resists this, we seek to turn the army into the career of choice of second sons of nobility. We start training them from a young age, which means we not only bind the nobility to us but we also create a corps of trained noble born officers for the future."
 bra_5:0 "The Goose Step"

 bra_6:0 "Regimental Cantons"
 bra_6_desc:0 "Peasants are naturally not keen on a lifetime of service in the Army, so they tend to run away when recruiters come along.

This should ensure a steadier supply of manpower for armies."
